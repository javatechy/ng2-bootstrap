# [Start Bootstrap]- [Angular 2 + Bootstrap ]

## Getting Started

To begin using this template, choose one of the following options to get started:

## Run The application
```shell
npm install
npm start
```
To update dependencies, run `bower update` and then run `gulp copy` to copy the updated dependencies into the `vendor` directory

## Issues
- Delete `src/app/main.ts` if you have one (we now use `src/main.ts` instead)
